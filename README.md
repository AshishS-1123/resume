# What is this repository?

In this repository, I have used the javascript library [pdfmake](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/0.1/) to generate my resume.

# Advantages

Some of the advantages of generating my resume this way are - 

1. Resume is generated using code - so very easy to customize.
2. Size of generated file is very small. Both of the files present in the `resumes` folder are ~33 KB in size.
3. Include keywords in meta data, for higher changes of getting past ATS systems.
4. Pdfmake is a well documented library.
